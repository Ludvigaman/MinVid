**MinVid** - (Swedish "MyVid", or Minimalistic Video host), is a simple self hosted video platform for those of you that want to keep your stash of videos private behind a password. 
This tube-like application is super simple to set up and takes basically nothing to host. It's built with an Angular front end, and a .NET backend.

**Features**
- Frontpage (latest 12 videos)
- Search (by title or tags)
- Video recommendations (score based on shared tags)
- Upload (Currently set to 1GB in _program.cs_) / Delete video features
- All videos stored locally on the API server, so you can technically add manual videos; or custom thumbnails.
- Automatic thumbnail generation using FFMPEG (comes packages with the API)
- Login feature (extremely simple, no users; just a "global" password)
