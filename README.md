MinVid - Minimalistic Video host is a simple solution for those who want a youtube like website where they can upload their own private videos etc. 
It's built with an Angular front end, and a .NET backend.

The idea is to have the following features:
- Videos, Recommendations
- Tags
- Upload / Delete features
- Library scanning if you add videos manually on the server-side
- Login for safety
